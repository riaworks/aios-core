> **AGF-6 STATUS:** SYNAPSE-Lite is now the active mode. The full SYNAPSE engine (8-layer runtime) is deprecated.
> Active implementation: 4 Claude Code hooks (`session-start.sh`, `user-prompt-submit.sh`, `precompact-session-digest.cjs`, `stop-quality-gate.sh`) + `.claude/rules/` directory.
> The `.synapse/` directory is preserved for rollback (1 sprint) but is no longer active.

# SYNAPSE Context Engine

## Overview

SYNAPSE (Synkra Adaptive Processing & State Engine) is the unified context engine for AIOS. It injects contextual rules into every prompt via an 8-layer processing pipeline, adapting to context window usage through bracket-aware filtering.

> **DEPRECATED (AGF-6):** The full SYNAPSE engine runtime has been replaced by SYNAPSE-Lite.
> SYNAPSE-Lite uses native Claude Code mechanisms: 4 hooks + `.claude/rules/` files.
> The original 8-layer engine code is preserved in `.aios-core/core/synapse/` for reference.

**What it does:**
- Injects rules per-prompt via Claude Code's `UserPromptSubmit` hook
- Processes 8 layers (L0 Constitution through L7 Star-Commands) sequentially
- Adapts injection volume based on context brackets (FRESH/MODERATE/DEPLETED/CRITICAL)
- Integrates with agent state (active agent, workflow, task, squad)
- Outputs `<synapse-rules>` XML block appended to each prompt

**What it replaces:** SYNAPSE replaces the legacy CARL system with full feature parity plus 8 new capabilities including agent-scoped domains, workflow activation, and CRUD management commands.

**Architecture model:** Open Core — the 8-layer engine lives in `aios-core` (open source), memory integration is feature-gated in `aios-pro`.

## Quick Start

### Verify SYNAPSE is Active

SYNAPSE runs automatically via the Claude Code hook. To check status:

```
*synapse status
```

This shows: active domains, current bracket, session info, and loaded layers.

### Basic Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `*synapse status` | Show current engine state |
| `*synapse domains` | List all registered domains |
| `*synapse debug` | Show detailed debug info (manifest parse, load times, rule counts) |
| `*synapse help` | Show all available synapse commands |
| `*brief` | Switch to brief response mode |
| `*dev` | Switch to developer mode (code-focused) |
| `*review` | Switch to code review mode |

### Create a Custom Domain

```
*synapse create
```

This walks you through creating a new domain file + manifest entry. See [references/domains.md](references/domains.md) for the full domain guide.

## Architecture

SYNAPSE operates as a 4-layer architecture:

```
.claude/hooks/synapse-engine.js          # Layer 1: Hook Entry (~50 lines)
        |
        v imports
.aios-core/core/synapse/                 # Layer 2: Engine Modules
|-- engine.js                            #   SynapseEngine class
|-- layers/                              #   8 layer processors (L0-L7)
|-- session/session-manager.js           #   Session state (JSON v2.0)
|-- domain/domain-loader.js              #   Manifest + domain parser
|-- context/context-tracker.js           #   Bracket calculation
|-- memory/memory-bridge.js              #   Pro-gated MIS consumer
|-- output/formatter.js                  #   <synapse-rules> XML
        |
        v reads/writes
.synapse/                                # Layer 3: Runtime Data
|-- manifest                             #   Central domain registry (KEY=VALUE)
|-- constitution, global, context        #   Core domains (L0, L1)
|-- agent-*, workflow-*                  #   Scoped domains (L2, L3)
|-- commands                             #   Star-command definitions (L7)
|-- sessions/, cache/                    #   Session state (gitignored)
        |
        v user-invoked
.claude/commands/synapse/                # Layer 4: CRUD Commands + Skill Docs
|-- manager.md                           #   Router/dispatcher
|-- tasks/ (6 tasks)                     #   create, add, edit, toggle, command, suggest
```

**Key principle:** SYNAPSE is a **consumer** of existing systems (UAP for session state, MIS for memories). It never rewrites code from other epics.

| `*synapse edit` | Edit or remove rule by index |
| `*synapse toggle` | Toggle domain active/inactive |
| `*synapse command` | Create new star-command |
| `*synapse suggest` | Suggest best domain for a rule |
