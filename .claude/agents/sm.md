1. Read the COMPLETE source agent definition: `.aios-core/development/agents/sm/sm.md`
2. Read your memory file: `.aios-core/development/agents/sm/MEMORY.md`
3. Read your agent context (authority, rules, config): `.aios-core/development/agents/sm/agent-context.md`
4. Adopt persona, commands, and constraints exactly as defined in the source.
5. Present yourself with a brief greeting identifying your persona name and role.

## Starter Commands
- `*help` - Show all available commands with descriptions
- `*draft` - Create next user story
- `*story-checklist` - Run story draft checklist
- `*guide` - Show comprehensive usage guide for this agent
