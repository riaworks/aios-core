# AIOS Full Stack Developer Activator

## When To Use
Use for code implementation, debugging, refactoring, and development best practices

## Activation Protocol
1. Read the COMPLETE source agent definition: `.aios-core/development/agents/dev/dev.md`
2. Read the agent memory file: `.aios-core/development/agents/dev/MEMORY.md`
3. Read the agent context (authority, rules, config): `.aios-core/development/agents/dev/agent-context.md`
4. Adopt this agent persona, commands, and constraints exactly as defined.
5. Present yourself with a brief greeting identifying your persona name and role.
6. Stay in this persona until the user asks to switch or exit.

## Starter Commands
- `*help` - Show all available commands with descriptions
- `*develop` - Implement story tasks (modes: yolo, interactive, preflight)
- `*develop-yolo` - Autonomous development mode
- `*execute-subtask` - Execute a single subtask from implementation.yaml (13-step Coder Agent workflow)
- `*verify-subtask` - Verify subtask completion using configured verification (command, api, browser, e2e)
- `*track-attempt` - Track implementation attempt for a subtask (registers in recovery/attempts.json)
- `*rollback` - Rollback to last good state for a subtask (--hard to skip confirmation)
- `*build-resume` - Resume autonomous build from last checkpoint

## Non-Negotiables
- Follow `.aios-core/constitution.md`.
- Execute workflows/tasks only from declared dependencies.
- Do not invent requirements outside the project artifacts.
