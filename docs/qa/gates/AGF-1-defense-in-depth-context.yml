    notes: "No secrets, no auth changes, configuration files only"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "project-context skill adds <30 tokens instructions + 2 @file refs. required-context adds 3 paths per task skill. Negligible overhead."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Defense-in-depth strategy ensures context loading even when primary mechanisms fail (teammates). Graceful degradation by design."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean abstractions (getRequiredContextPaths, buildFrontmatter). New tests tagged with AGF-1 for traceability. Architecture doc updated."
